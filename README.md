## Game Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Using NPM package and JavaScript knoledge to build and test the game.

### Installation

- Fork this repository into your own account
- Run npm install to run all of the dependencies into your local repository
- Run the command 'npm start' to start the game running into your local machine.
- Finally, open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) on your browser.

### Game Concept

It is the year 2025. Space X, in collaboration with Nasa, has been able to develop a spaceship with the capacity to travel all the way to Mars. Once thought as a crazy person, Elon Musk, leads a new adventure and becomes humanity's hope for a better future. On earth, global warming has reached a critical point and thus, the earth will no longer be viable to live in. Mars has become our only hope if we want humanity to survive.
 
Elon Musk has reached out to you because of your awesome ability to procrastinate important work playing arcade games.
 
If you accept this mission, you'll lead team Mars by navigating our spaceship into the wild and dark space. Our research shows that you’ll have to fight through several obstacles to complete your mission.
 
To make things worst, Robo-Mars, the autonomous spaceship that had all of the supplies for the return journey has been hit by an asteroid, leaving supplies all over the universe. Surprisingly, they kept their position and thus your spaceship can recollect them on your way to Mars. The more supplies you capture, the more you'll be likely to have enough resources for the return trip.
 
Do you think you can lead your way into Mars?

### Main Objective

Survive as long as possible and collect as many resources as possible. Try to get to mars at all costs.

### How to play

- To move the Mars spaceship you should use the 'left' and 'right' arrow keys on your keyboard.
- Accelerate by pressing the 'up' arrow on your keyboard.
- Slow down by pessing the 'down' arrow on your keyboard.
- Shoot your power gun by pressing the 'space' bar on your keyword
- Collect supplies in order to increase your score for the return mission.
- Avoid all obstacles to keep your team alive.

#### Marsian (The Spaceship )

![Marsian]()

- Marsian was build with the latest technology.

#### Enemies

![Space storm]()

- Storms are the worst. You must travel through them avoiding any mortal collision.

![Asteroids]()

- Space is full of asteroids. Avoid them at all cost. 

![UFO]()

- UFO's have been detected. They seem harmful and will try to sabotage this mission as they want to conquer Mars as well.

![Magnetic bugs]()

- Human garbage send into space has muted into magnetic bugs. These will feel atracted to the spaceship and make your spacecraft heavier and more prompt to collide with other space items. 

![Human garbage]()

- Right after take off, Earth orbit is full of garbage. You must skip this and avoid any mortal collision.

#### Resources

![Fuel capsules]()

- We don't know why does the fuel capsules have stayed within the Marsian route towards Mars, but we must take advantage of it. Collect as much as possible so we can have enough resources for the return trip.

![water]()

- Our water supplies are low, because our supply machine within the spaceship has broken. Collect water along the way so you can make it back home.

![medical aid]()

- Collect medical aid equipment that you can use in case you have an emergency.

## Game Development Stages

- **Day 1**
**Learn Phaser 3 module**
 I code along the Phaser 3 space shooter tutorial learning the basics about how to structure the project. I setup as well the current repo, installing Webpack and Phaser 3, thinking about the game logic. Manage to complete this steps without any problems.

- **Day 2**
**Game Design**
 Pulish the game concept, define the characters and main objective. Look for assets to implement all of the game scenes. Define the game rules and logic. Work on the storytelling to make it attractive. Plan the development of the game in specific chunks of user stories converted to technical tasks to be done.
