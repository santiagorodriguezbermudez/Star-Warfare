- Fork this repository into your own account
- Run npm install to run all of the dependencies into your local repository
- Run the command 'npm start' to start the game running into your local machine.

### Game Concept

It's 2025, Space X in collaboration with Nasa have been able to develop a spaceship with the capacity to travel all the way to Mars. Once thought as a crazy person, Elon Musk, leads the new adventure and becomes humanity's hope for a better future. On earth, global warming has reached a critical point and thus, earth will no longer be viable to live in. Mars has become our only hope if we want humanity to survive.

Elon Musk has reach out to you because of your awesome ability to procrastinate important work playing arcade games. 

As your mission, you'll lead team Mars by navigating our spaceship into the wild and dark space. Once the space mission begins, the mars team discover several obstacles in the way, including extraterrestrial forces, that become a blocker for team Mars to achieve their goal.

To make things worst, Robo-Mars, the autonomous spaceship that had all of the fuel supplies for the return journey has been hit by an asteriod leaving fuel capsules all over the universe. Surprisingly, they keep their position and thus your spaceship can recolect them on your way to Mars. The more fuel capsules you capture, you'll be more likely to have resources for the return trip.

You think you can lead your way into Mars?

### How to play

- To move the Mars spaceship you should use the 'left' and 'right' arrow keys on your keyboard.
- Accelerate by pressing the 'up' arrow on your keyboard.
- Slow down by pessing the 'down' arrow on your keyboard.
- Shoot your power gun by pressing the 'space' bar on your keyword
- Collect stars in order to increase your score for the return mission.
- Avoid all obstacles to keep your team alive.

#### Marsian (The Spaceship )

![Marsian]()

- Marsian was build with the latest technology.

#### Interactive Scenario

![Fuel capsules]()

- We don't know why does the fuel capsules have stayed within the Marsian route towards Mars, but we must take advantage of it. Collect as much as possible so we can have enough resources for the return trip.

![Asteroids]()

- Space is full of asteroids. Avoid them at all cost. 

![ufo]()

- UFO's have been detected. They seem harmful and will try to sabotage this mission as they want to conquer Mars as well.

## Game Development Stages

- **Day 1**
**Learn Phaser 3 module**
 I code along the Phaser 3 space shooter tutorial learning the basics about how to structure the project. I setup as well the current repo, installing Webpack and Phaser 3, thinking about the game logic. Manage to complete this steps. 

- **Day 2**
**Game Design**
 Pulish the game concept, define the characters and main objective. Look for assets to implement all of the game scenes. Define the game rules and logic. Work on the storytelling to make it attractive. Plan the development of the game in specific chunks of user stories converted to technical tasks to be done.
